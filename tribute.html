    <h3>My life before</h3>
      <p>The first thing I remember is that I lived in an apartment, on the 5th floor, in one of these large buildings. And then, one day, I fell from the window sill. A hell of a fall!</p>
      <p>Afterwards, there were humans from the ERA association who took me in. They took me directly to the vet to check on my health. Fortunately, I didn't have any consequences of my fall.</p>
      <p>Then the association placed me in a host family who already owned two cats. But I don't like my peers. I just arrived, I have to show that I am the chef, so I spit and attack my companions. I don't know what they want from me, but I don't like them. Suddenly, humans locked me in a room to avoid conflicts. But they regularly came to see me, give me hugs and offer me some treats.</p>
        <p>
After a few weeks in my temporary family, a couple of humans come to see me. I hear the doorbell, quickly, I have to hide. But I am greedy, and a few treats were enough to bring me out, with suspicion, of my hiding place. I think the two humans like me in the end. I was kind and cute during the visit.</p>
        <p>The association had posed some restrictions for my future life: I must be the only feline of the house and I can perfectly live in an apartment, because I only knew this kind of life. However, I have heard that new humans have a rabbit. I'm not sure what it is, but I will quickly make myself respected!</p>
        <p>A few days after the visit, the two come back. But with a cage this time. They are trying to put me in the cage, but that is out of the question. The cage means vet, needles and operating table. Never !</p>
        <p>In the end, with the help of a few treats, they finally managed to get me in. And here we go by car now! I hate that ! So I have to point out ... I push my mews of distress, maybe they will let me out. Meow, meow, meow. For 15 minutes, without stopping for a single second! Nothing helps, they do not stop ... Too bad, I will continue.</p>
      <p>Ah! Here we stop! And it's not at the vet!</p>
    
    <h3>My new life</h3>
      <p>That's it, we're coming to a new apartment!</p>
      <p>Humans put me in a room and open the door of my cage. I'm not crazy, I'm not going out.</p>
      <p>Well, it's been a while since they left me alone, I'm going to explore my new house. But slowly, I have to be careful.</p>
      <p>I've been exploring for a while, it's tiring. I'm going to lay down ... here, near the door. Perfect.</p>
    <img class="image" id="oreo-porte" src="https://i.postimg.cc/T3RGGLzF/20190323-202726-2.jpg" alt="Oréo lying againt the door.">
    <p>Okay, now that I've gone around, it's time to meet this animal, the "rabbit". Humans call him Choup. I just hope it's not a cat.</p>
    <img class="image" id="oreo-choup" src="https://i.postimg.cc/8ct46YCh/20190326-214728.jpg" alt="Oréo meets Choup.">
    <p>In the end, it's fine. It doesn't really look like a cat. He's a little weird, he keeps jumping instead of walking like I do. And then those big ears! It must be hard to wash ...</p>
    <p>I think I like my new house. Humans are nice, even if they annoy me often, the rabbit is a bit like a toy. I'm having fun, and then I have lots of cat trees and toys! I will put you pictures, I promise!</p>
    <p>Time flies, I'm enjoying my new life. And then one morning the humans get up, go see the rabbit, and then they're all stressed out. They pick up the phone, then put the rabbit in a cage (it was very limp that day), and they leave. I didn't understand everything ... Half an hour later, they came back with the cage, but it was empty. No more rabbits. It's still weird! I bet my life on it, it still smells of rabbit in the cage. And then humans are very sad. I think I'm doing my sweetie today, it's not too much time to make fooleries ...</p>
    <p>The next day, humans put away all of the rabbit's belongings. I think they got rid of it. But I don't understand why, they liked this little creature ... And then I have more friends to hunt. It's still a bit bad ...</p>
    <p>It's been a month since there has been no rabbit. I have already forgotten all that, I enjoy life, I take my naps in the sun, I do all my nonsense as usual. And then hop, humans take my car box and leave. They take MY box and leave WITHOUT ME! I think they forgot something ... Well, we're going to wait behind the door for them to come back. An hour later, here they come, they put the box in the living room, put the grids of the enclosure back. I arrive, I come to see, and I smell something that reminds me of ... A rabbit! They brought a rabbit again! But this one is very small, and all brown! And then he has his ears down. It's still a bit silly, I'm sure he doesn't hear very well.</p>
    <p class="quote">What's his name, again ? ... Oh! Yes! Snoot.</p>
    <img class="image" id="snoot" src="https://i.postimg.cc/rF7YwHZv/20190718-100953-2.jpg" alt="Boople Snoot">
    <p>I want so much to play with it, to bite his huge ears, but humans are fighting over me. Supposedly, he is small and I risk hurting him. It's okay, it's not that small either! So I try to play softly with him, I kick him and I go. It's still funny!</p>
    <p>And time goes by and the little Snoot grows quickly. And a lot. And it's not that small anymore. Now when I go to play with him he rushes at me and makes a big "honk". It's scary!</p>
    <p>I have to tell you! One day, I was in Snoot's enclosure, and then I kicked his pompom when he walked past me. And guess what he did? He just threw a stream of urine on my paw! Like, on my poor little paw, when I didn't do anything to him. So I wanted to wash, anyway, but it's really not good. I'm fine when I wash myself, but rabbit urine, yuck! And there humans came, and they washed my paw with a wet cloth. So, I still had to wash, but it's okay, the water is less worse. I swear, this rabbit is nonsense! He thinks he's the chef, he does what he wants. But still he lowers his head in front of me, so that means I'm his boss, right? Well imagine that not. If he lowers his head and I put my paw on his head, like "nice little rabbit", suddenly he lifts his head and he pisses at me with his big "honk". I still don't understand everything ... But hey, it's okay, he's pretty nice, we can take a nap together.</p>
    
    <p>Finally, all that to tell you that now I have a real family, who is nice to me. The other time, we went on vacation. And you know, me and the car, it's two. But finally, it was okay, it was still funny (even if humans often left me alone with the rabbit to go outside ...).</p>

    <p>All this would not have been possible without the help of the <a href="https://www.assocera.com/" target="_blank" id="tribute-link">ERA</a> association. So I tell you: Thank you ERA for finding me a family for life!</p>
